# Honeywell_Hackathon
This repository contains the code and resources for a hackathon project on F&amp;B Process Anomaly Prediction. It features a machine learning model that analyzes multi-variable process data (e.g., temperature, mixer speed) to identify deviations from normal production and predict potential product quality issues.
